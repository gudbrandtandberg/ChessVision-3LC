# ChessVision Test Set

This folder contains batches of test images collected for evaluating the ChessVision model.

Each of the batches contains sub-folders "raw", containing the test images, and "ground_truth", containing the ground truth FENs.

All batches after the "initial" batch are named from the date range they were collected.
